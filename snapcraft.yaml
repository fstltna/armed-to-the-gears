summary:  Armed to the Gears is a 3D/isometric game
description: |
  Armed to the Gears is a 3D/isometric game that combines Real-time Strategy, Capture-the-Flag and Tower Defense genres, all into a simple concept. Set in a dystopic, totalitarian future where the government, under the flag of the Ministry, is using robots to enslave the whole population. You are the Rebellion's best engineer, who's able to hack into the Ministry's Infantry Class robots and use their own weapons against them. Your Mission: Capture and maintain every reactor on the map by standing next to them for a few seconds. Captured Reactors will grant Energy points, used to teleport turrets, call air support into the battle field and repair your robot.
